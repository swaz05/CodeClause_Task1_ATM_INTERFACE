# CodeClause_Task1_ATM_INTERFACE
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Java is a software application that emulates the functionality of a real-world ATM. The purpose of this interface is to allow users to perform various banking transactions without the need for human intervention, providing convenience and accessibility to account holders.

Here's a short note on the key components and features of an ATM interface using Java:

1. **User Authentication**: To ensure security, the ATM interface requires users to authenticate themselves using a unique identification method, such as a PIN (Personal Identification Number) or a biometric scan. This step is crucial to verify the user's identity and grant access to their account.

2. **Main Menu**: After successful authentication, the user is presented with a main menu that displays a list of available banking services. Common options include "Check Balance," "Withdraw Funds," "Deposit Funds," "Transfer Money," and "Change PIN."

3. **Check Balance**: This option allows users to view the current balance of their account. The interface retrieves and displays the account balance from the bank's database.

4. **Withdraw Funds**: Users can specify the amount they wish to withdraw from their account. The ATM interface validates if the requested amount is available and dispenses the cash if possible.

5. **Deposit Funds**: This feature allows users to deposit cash or checks into their account. The interface typically accepts the deposit amount and updates the account balance accordingly.

6. **Transaction History**: Some ATM interfaces offer the option to view the account's transaction history, showing recent transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

7. **EXIT**: After completing their transactions, users can log out of the ATM interface to end their session securely.

Implementing an ATM interface using Java involves using appropriate data structures, algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The backend typically interacts with a database to store and retrieve user account information and transaction details.

While this short note provides an overview of the essential components, building a full-fledged ATM interface also involves considering security measures, user experience, and integration with the bank's core systems. Additionally, the implementation would require adherence to coding best practices and potentially leveraging third-party libraries for enhanced functionality.

Note: This is a simplified description of an ATM interface using Java. In real-world scenarios, there are many additional aspects to consider, such as encryption, network communication, transaction logging, and compliance with banking regulations.
